<p>Dear <span class="doubtful">Boss</span></p>
<p>Many thanks for your letter. We were all rather hurt, when we read the description of that fight of 30th in the Summary. I wrote a description the next day and gave it to General Hunter Weston -</p>
<p>The fight commenced at daybreak by heavy Arty fire from all sorts if guns. This went on on practically the whole day till about 4 pm assisted by strong rifle fire from the German trenches. During the whole time the Germans were getting closer &amp; closer, digging themeselves in.</p>
<p>The battalion was at the time holding the front from <span class="place">the <span class="place">LE GHEER</span> X roads</span> to <span class="place">the River DOUVE</span>. Every available man and officer was in the trenches, many of which were quite isolated as we had had no time to dig communication trenches.  Our centre was <span class="place"><span class="place">ST YVES</span> X roads</span>.</p>
<p>The German attack was directed against the Company (C Coy) holding the right centre. It was one of the left trenches held by this company that the Germans got thro', but not before the officer and every man had been either killed or wounded. The trench was practically destroyed by the heavy "Jack Johnsons". The only man of the platoon who is alive was sent with a message shortly after Lieut Trimmer was killed. A wounded Sgt was found in the trench when re-captured and is now in hospital (Sgt McCabe). He will be the only man to tell us exactly what did happen. But that night it was reported that there were some 70 or 80 dead Germans in front of the trench.</p>
<p>The Coy Comdr Capt Harland had been killed early in the day. The Company was then in charge of Lieut Atchison who had with him Lieut Wade in charge of M.Gs. Lieut Atchison was also hit, but continued to direct as far as he was able, but being hit in the head was rather knocked out.</p>
<p>As darkness came on Lieut Wade, who was working the M.Gs, saw what was happening to his left front, and that the Germans would perhaps break thro. He immediately shifted his M.G. to fire on this front, at the same time ordered a barricade to be made and manned it with a few men &amp; a M.G. under Sgt Dacombe. it was this action that saved the situation. For after having knocked out Lt Trimmer's platoon, the Germans came in force, but were badly enfiladed by the M.G.s and men in the barricade, which killed two German officers, who were apparently leading the attack, for the Germans only went about 50 yards passed the road &amp; barricade, then retired and got into houses &amp; under any cover they could find.</p>

<p>When the report reached me that the Germans had broken thro', I asked Major Prowse S.L.I. to counter attack with a company. He sent a company under two subalterns who attacked from the north along both sides of the road, drawing towards the barricade where Major Prowse and myself were. This attack was well carried out. They rounded up a few Germans whom they found in houses - but the main body of Germans had retired.</p>
<p>Practically the same thing occurred the next night (31st). The Germans attacking a trench still further to the left held by a section. This trench was nearly destroyed, attacked &amp; occupied by Germans for a few hours, counter attacked by S.L.I was not taken, but was eventually evacuated by Germans before dawn. Only two men succeeded in getting out, one uninjured and one wounded. Both had been buried, and managed to creep out after the Germans had left.</p>
