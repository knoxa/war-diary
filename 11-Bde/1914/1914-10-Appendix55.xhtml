Captain Kirkpatrick and Lieut Alexander are in trenches leaving Aplin here with supporting platoon <span class="stop">AAA</span>

<h2>Eleventh Brigade</h2>
<p>Report on Infantry attack delivered against my left centre yesterday.</p>
<p>It appears that after a heavy bombardment in which the trenches on the North of ST YVES Road and the two which sit astride the road running East from the Estaminet &amp; held by Lieut Trimmer's platoon were all badly damaged. Lieut Trimmer's platoon suffering very heavily. It is thought that few of his men were left when the Infantry arrived about 4 pm.
It was apparently against these two trenches that the attack was pressed home &amp; which eventually penetrated the line.
When Lt Trimmer's trenches were visited all the men were in them still, all but one being dead, the survivor is badly wounded.
They appear to have fought it out to the last. Lt Atchinson &amp; Wade, realizing the danger a penetration on their left would involve, hastily constructed a barricade on the road at the N. end of the cutting  which enabled them to mount a Maxim gun and collect a few rifles behind it &amp; thus enfilading the Germans as they crossed the road.
The enemy after advancing about 50 yards W. of the road realized their danger &amp; retired, many no doubt taking what cover they could in buildings etc.
It is estimated that about 60 Germans got through, but as it took place after dusk numbers were difficult to estimate but this number were actually seen.</p>
<p>The Germans made no attempt to establish themselves in the buildings &amp; when Maj. Prowse entered them they were empty.</p>

I have seen Genls Briggs and De Lisle. The latter informs me that KOYLI &amp; KOSB are just coming up to attack one each side of MESSINES.
Received your message <span class="doubtful">pointing</span> line of retirement but we can hang on if only the Germans could be driven out of MESSINES.
</p>
<p>
I am occupying trenches from River Douave almost to MESSINES. Have seen lots of Germans retiring. A little energy &amp; the whole lot could be thrown out.
But I cannot do any more with 3 companies. Onne hold trenches. One is attacking the South edge of MESSINES. One is lying on my right flank ready for counter attack because we have seen the enemy massing between us &amp; Hampshires
</p>
<br/>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p>
The town of MESSINES is only partly occupied by Germans &amp; they must be hunted out of it or they with enfilade whole position.

Would it be possible to arrange for the Artillery observing officer to remain at my headquarters during the day.
He was with me yesterday &amp; rendered valuable assistance.
I received a message this morning from H.Q. Artillery that one officer would come down but he has never turned up.
It is with the greatest difficulty that I have been able to communicate with the Artillery or get any support from them.
Message just received that the guns have moved and cannot take a target of machine guns in front of my centre companies.

Situation in my front appears to be as follows.
RIF BRIG quiet day. Enemy reported to be continuing work on entrenchment already reported <span class="stop">AAA</span>
E LANCS had heavy shooting at dusk after heavy bombardment during afternoon. Have not yet had report from them on situation but it seems satisfactory, as all firing has stopped <span class="stop">AAA</span>
HANTS 3 Coys and 1 Coy SOMERSETS in left centre of their line have  sustained very heavy bombardment followed by infantry attacks <span class="stop">AAA</span>
Infantry attacks have been repulsed but casualties in their right Coy &amp; left centre Coy appear to have been heavy <span class="stop">AAA</span>
Inniskillings North of RIVER DOUVRE are holding the original line of trenches between MESSINES and the R of DOUVE R <span class="stop">AAA</span>
They appear to be quite happy <span class="stop">AAA</span>
The position of the cavalry on their left I have already reported to you <span class="stop">AAA</span>
The LANC FUS and one Coy INNISK FUS are in reserve, two Coys north of PLOEGSTEERT remainder in trenches NE and N of pt 63 <span class="stop">AAA</span>
Our cyclists and cavalry also in reserve at PLOEGSTEERT <span class="stop">AAA</span>
Position therefore tonight is generally satisfactory

The first Cav Div report that the following arangements have been made tonight for the defence of the line DOUVE river to the 4th Kilo stone WYTSCHAETE - Messines road <span class="stop">AAA</span>
On the right 3 Coys 11th Inf Brig, in the centre K.O.S.B &amp; K.O.Y.L.I (14th Inf Brig), left 2nd Cav Bde, all under the command of Colonel Mullins 2nd Cav Bde at NEUVE EGLISE <span class="stop">AAA</span>
A few houses including one of our barricades east of Messines are still held by a few Germans &amp; machine guns, these will be attacked with the bayonet tonight and it is hoped to hold Messines like a fortress <span class="stop">AAA</span>
To retake the position we held yesterday would require a whole division as we have made very little impression today with a total of six battalions from the North &amp; East <span class="stop">AAA</span>
1st Cav Div HdQrs will be at DRANOUTRE <span class="stop">AAA</span>
</p>
<p>
From the above it would appear that the 1st Cav Div cannot release the Innis Fus <span class="stop">AAA</span>

<p>Situation Report</p>
<p>Right Company - Heavily shelled since 3 pm. Enemy made strong attack against Capt Moore's left but they were driven back from close quarters with assistance of reserve platoon.
The Platoon of E. Lancs are in reserve &amp; I have told Capt. Moore to return them if not wanted.</p>
<p>Right Centre Coy - Suffered Casualties &amp; line begins to get thin in places. Enemy attacked at dusk &amp; repulsed. Coy Cmdr (Capt Beckett) reports 
"did considerable execution with rapid fire &amp; a good moon. Silenced one machine gun. Men quite cheery."</p>
<p>The burnt farm in front of left of this company is occupied by Germans. Artillery fire would be of great assistance at the point.</p>
<p>Left Centre Coy - C Coy S.L.I. and 1 Platoon Hants. Capt Watson reports all satisfactory. Enemy made a half hearted attempt to break through where they did last night. They were repulsed. This portion of the line has been heavily shelled.</p>
<p>Left Coy "B" - No report from this Company since 5.40 pm when situation was satisfactory. Will report on this section later.</p>
<p>
Situation generally satisfactory but casualties due to shelling are thinning the line in places. A further report just received from the Right Centre Company states that 30 men are essential to fill gaps. 
I would suggest Somersets taking our whole of Left Centre Coy - relieving one of my platoons of C Coy - I could then fill gaps which have already occurred, while the other 2 platoons could be used to fill subsequent gaps &amp; be able to relieve any trench which may have suffered heavily.
The third platoon of this Coy is nonexistent, it was wiped out yesterday.
We have had very little Artillery support today.

No serious attacks have been made on 2nd or 3rd corps today.

<h2>SUMMARY OF INFORMATION</h2>

<p> 1. &nbsp;
There is no change in frontage occupied by the IIIrd Corps. 
The centre and right have been subjected to some shelling, but no infantry attack has been made on this portion of our line.
</p>
<p>
About ST. YVES however, the enemy (consisting of a battalion of the 134th Regiment, XIX Saxon Corps) made a determined attack last night and captured the village, but the Somersetshire L.I. under Major Prowse, counter-attacked and drove the enemy out, thus restoring the line.
</p>

<p> 2. &nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NORTH OF THE LYS</span>.
</p>
<p>
The village of MESSINES was very heavily shelled yesterday and a hostile infantry attack developed in the evening from the DOUVE Valley.
Our troops however maintained their position in this locality during the night. This morning most of the village was evacuated by our troops, and it is now partly in our hands and partly in the hands of the Germans.
</p>
<p>
North of MESSINES and between that place and GHELUVELT, the enemy has developed  numerous forces and has been making a strong attack ever since yesterday at mid-day in the direction of YPRES.
This attack made some progress at first and drove back our advanced troops, but has not been, and is not likely to be successful in acheiving its object, that is, to reach the town of YPRES.
Our troops have delivered a counter-attack today on the enemy, but no report has yet been received as to the result.
</p>
<p>
North of YPRES the enemy has made repeated attacks against the allied troops and has suffered very heavily without making any progress whatever. The Allies near NIEUPORT took 210 prisoners yesterday.
</p>
<p>A German aeroplane was brought down yesterday near YPRES.</p>

<p> 3. &nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">SOUTH OF THE LYS</span>.
</p>
<p>An attack was made on our IInd Corps yesterday and was repulsed without loss.</p>
<p>The Allies have gained a considerable amount of ground and pressed back the German line about ALBERT.</p>

<p> 4. &nbsp; The 48th Reserve Division of the XXIV Reserve Corps is still located in the country just N.W. of FROMELLES.
</p>
<p>The 134th Regiment (XIX Saxon Corps) was located last night about ST. YVES. This Corps cannot have moved very far if at all.</p>
<p>The 119th and 125th Regiments of the XIII Corps have been located in today's fighting about MESSINES.
Most of the units of this Corps were located last week in the region about FROMELLES and it seems now almost certain that this Corps was pulled out about 4 nights ago and the XXIV Reserve Corps was put in its place.
The XIII Corps, or a portion of it, has evidently moved N. of the LYS to the neighbourhood of MESSINES.</p>
<p>Two Bavarian Jager Battalions have been located about MESSINES and ST. YVES. It seems possible that these are the same battalions which were supporting the Bavarian Cavalry Division and have now been thrown into the fight.</p>
<p>The XXV Reserve Corps which is the only one of the newly raised Corps which has not been brought into action in the Western theatre has now been definitely located against the Russians.</p>

<p> 5. &nbsp;
In LORRAINE the French have driven the Germans back over the frontier between the Forests of BEZANGE and PARROY.
</p>

<p> 6. &nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">RUSSIA</span>.
The Russian success in POLAND is much greater than was at first believed.
Not only have the German troops N. of the R. PILITZA been driven back and defeated, but now it is officially reported that the Austro-German troops have suffered a heavy defeat in a battle which subsequently took place S. of that River, and the Russians by the 28th had reached the line RADON - LODZ.
The Austro-German Army was in full retreat to the South-west.
</p>
<p>South of the PRZEMYSL the Russians surrounded and annihilated the 38th Honved Division (Austria) near PODBUZ.</p>
<p>Great importance is attached to this victory of the Russians over the Austro-German forces.</p>
