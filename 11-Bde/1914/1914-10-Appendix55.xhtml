Captain Kirkpatrick and Lieut Alexander are in trenches leaving Aplin here with supporting platoon <span class="stop">AAA</span>

<h2>Eleventh Brigade</h2>
<p>Report on Infantry attack delivered against my left centre yesterday.</p>
<p>It appears that after a heavy bombardment in which the trenches on the North of ST YVES Road and the two which sit astride the road running East from the Estaminet &amp; held by Lieut Trimmer's platoon were all badly damaged. Lieut Trimmer's platoon suffering very heavily. It is thought that few of his men were left when the Infantry arrived about 4 pm.
It was apparently against these two trenches that the attack was pressed home &amp; which eventually penetrated the line.
When Lt Trimmer's trenches were visited all the men were in them still, all but one being dead, the survivor is badly wounded.
They appear to have fought it out to the last. Lt Atchinson &amp; Wade, realizing the danger a penetration on their left would involve, hastily constructed a barricade on the road at the N. end of the cutting  which enabled them to mount a Maxim gun and collect a few rifles behind it &amp; thus enfilading the Germans as they crossed the road.
The enemy after advancing about 50 yards W. of the road realized their danger &amp; retired, many no doubt taking what cover they could in buildings etc.
It is estimated that about 60 Germans got through, but as it took place after dusk numbers were difficult to estimate but this number were actually seen.</p>
<p>The Germans made no attempt to establish themselves in the buildings &amp; when Maj. Prowse entered them they were empty.</p>

I have seen Genls Briggs and De Lisle. The latter informs me that KOYLI &amp; KOSB are just coming up to attack one each side of MESSINES.
Received your message <span class="doubtful">pointing</span> line of retirement but we can hang on if only the Germans could be driven out of MESSINES.
</p>
<p>
I am occupying trenches from River Douave almost to MESSINES. Have seen lots of Germans retiring. A little energy &amp; the whole lot could be thrown out.
But I cannot do any more with 3 companies. Onne hold trenches. One is attacking the South edge of MESSINES. One is lying on my right flank ready for counter attack because we have seen the enemy massing between us &amp; Hampshires
</p>
<br/>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p>
The town of MESSINES is only partly occupied by Germans &amp; they must be hunted out of it or they with enfilade whole position.

The former plays on the top trench which we took from Germans this morning.
My subaltern was wounded while leading the attack (Brandon Thomas by name)

The HANTS are on my right
</p>
<p>
I have one company &amp; headquarters (about 35 rifles) and one platoon A. Co. Som L.I. in reserve close to bridge where road crosses the Douave
</p>
<p>
