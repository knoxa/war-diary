Account of the Action of the 11<sup>th</sup> INFANTRY BRIGADE on the 26th August 1914 between <span class="place">FONTAINE-AU-PIRE</span> 
and <span class="place">LIGNY-EN-CAMBRESIS</span> West of <span class="place">LE CATEAU</span>.
</p>

<p>
After a continuous night march from <span class="place"><span class="place">BRIASTRE</span> 1&frac12; miles S. of <span class="place">SOLESMES</span></span>, the 11<sup>th</sup> 
Infantry Brigade halted for 1&frac12; hours at the northern end of <span class="place">FONTAINE-AU-PIRE</span> at 2-45 am on 26<sup>th</sup> August 1914.
At 4-14 am as the brigade was about to resume its march, rifle, machine gun and shell fire was <span class="uncertain">offered</span> 
on the outposts WEST of the village of <span class="place">BEAUVOIS</span>. While the Rifle Brigade held off this attack from the N. and N.W, the
Somerset L I were pushed forward into the Southern end of <span class="place">BEAUVOIS</span> to hold off the enemy to the N.E. and to ensure the safe passage
of all wheeled vehicles to the EAST and then to the SOUTH, the direct roads South from the halting place being impassable owing to
the wet. Under cover of these two Battalions, the other two Battalions of the Brigade moved SOUTH and took up a position on the 
ridge of which <span class="place"><span class="place"><span class="place">CARRIÈRES</span> (the Quarry)</span> &frac12; mile S.W. of the village of <span class="place">FONTAINE-AU-PIRE</span></span> is the centre. All the transport was 
successfully got away, but owing to the necessity of having to stick to the roads, the 1<sup>st</sup> Line Transport had to go a 
long way round before it could again approach the Infantry. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Line Transport was ordered back to <span class="place">SELVINGLY</span>, which
it reached safely in due course.

Under cover of the fire of the 1<sup>st</sup> Bn Hampshire Regt the two advanced Battalions retired on <span class="place">LA CARRIÈRE</span>. The Somerset L.I. 
(1&frac12; Coys.) occupying <span class="place">the Eastern end of the Quarry</span> while a company of the E. LANCS occupied the Western end. The Somersets
prolonged their own line from <span class="place">LA CARRIÈRE</span> to the S.E, sending two companys back towards  <span class="place">LIGNY</span> to entrench a position N. of that town.

The three remaining Coys. of the E. LANCS also retired to <span class="place">the slope N. of <span class="place">LIGNY</span>. W. and S.W. of <span class="place">CARRIÈRE</span></span> the line was taken up by the
Hampshires whose left rested on <span class="place">the edge of the plateau. S. of the Railway line</span>, the Brigade having thus established itself on <span class="place">the 
CARRIÈRE Ridge</span>, the Coys. of the E. LANCS and Somersets were recalled from their covering positions N. of <span class="place">LIGNY</span> and formed local reserves 
on the WEST and EAST flanks of <span class="place">the <span class="place">CARRIÈRE</span> position</span>.

Against the 11<sup>th</sup> Inf. Bde, the enemy concentrated a very heavy fire both from field guns and machine guns.
The Rifle fire was not heavy as the Cavalry and afterwards the Infantry kept at a respectful distance and did not venture
to show themselves on the smooth glacis-like slope which lay in front of the position.

The hostile Infantry however worked round both flanks, attacking from the N.W. along the line of the 
Railway and on the N.E. establishing themselves in <span class="place">the Southern outskirts of the village</span>. The enemy fire was uninterrupted and
severe, and on four occassions caused the troops in the more advanced positions to retire, on each occassion though, they were
either led back or replaced by fresh troops and the position was successfully maintained.

At about 3 p.m. the 5<sup>th</sup> Div. having returned from <span class="place">CAUDRY</span>, it was seen that to hold <span class="place">the <span class="place">CARRIÈRES</span> position</span> any longer
would lead to the Brigade being taken in reverse. In accordance therefore with Divisional instructions the Brigade made preparation
to retire to <span class="place">LIGNY</span>. This retirement was carefully organised with close co-operation between the Infantry and Artillery, which latter
took up positions <span class="place">in and to the W. of <span class="place">LIGNY</span></span>, ready to engage enemy's Artillery and Infantry to cover our retirement.

The Infantry, with the Rifle Brigade left on the position as a rearguard, was formed up in lines on <span class="place">the dead ground S. of the <span class="place">RAVIN WARNELLE</span></span>, whence on the command being given it moved off in good order towards the village of <span class="place">LIGNY</span>.

Each Battalion was given a separate objective viz:- Hampshire to <span class="place">W. of village</span>; E LANCS to <span class="place">right centre of village</span>; Somersets to
E end of village; the Rifle Brigade following towards the left centre.

The shrapnel fire on our troops was very severe, notwithstanding the support given by our guns. There were a good number of casualties
but considering the way the whole ground was plastered with shrapnel bullets, it was surprising that the casualties were not
greater.

On arrival at <span class="place">LIGNY</span>, the Battalions reformed in the localities that had been alloted to them and took up the defense of the front 
edge of their respective portion of the village.

As soon as the rearguard quitted <span class="place">the <span class="place">CARRIÈRES</span> position</span> the German Infantry, which up to that time had kept themselves carefully
concealed, advanced in large numbers on the <span class="place">CAUDRY</span> side of that position. They afforded excellent targets to our Artillery and their 
formations were speedily broken up by our shrapnel fire.

Shortly after the Brigade had established itself at <span class="place">LIGNY</span> an attack was made on the N.E. and E. of the village by German Infantry.
This attack was pushed in twice, but on each occasion was repulsed with heavy loss. Shortly before 5 p.m. the Brigade was ordered to retire via 
<span class="place">CAULLERY</span> toward <span class="place">MALINCOURT</span>. This retirement having to be conducted under heavy artillery fire the formation adopted was that of small
columns of fours each as far as possible under an officer. After passing <span class="place">CAULLERY</span> the enemy's pursuit by Artillery fire died away owing as 
we afterwards learned to the attack on the Germans from the N.W. by a French Corps. In connection with the above very trying operations,
I should like to bring to notice the good services of the following Officers, N.C.O's and men.

<p>
The above officers, NCOs &amp; men are those to whom, in my opinion, we most owe it that the 11<sup>th</sup> Inf Brig held on for 
ten hours to its dominating position S.W of <span class="place">FONTAINE-AU-PIRE</span>, the highest point of the <span class="place">CAUDRY</span> - <span class="place">CREVE COURT</span> ridge.
</p>
<p>
The position was attacked from W-N-W south of the railway right round by the north to the E-N-E south of the village of 
<span class="place">FONTAINE-AU-PIRE</span>, and the fire was so severe that the men in the firing lines, after heavy losses in leaders and men, retired
precipitantly on four occasions.
</p>
<p>
It was only by the personal example of the Officers and NCOs that they, or fresh troops, were led forward again to re-occupy the firing line.
</p>
<p>
If this position, which was unsupported by the fire of other troops had been evacuated early in the day, the results of the consequent advance
of the German enveloping attack from the N.W. could not have been other than disastrous to the remainder of our army. I therefore
recommend them all for special recognition. My reasons for each are as under:-
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Maj Rickman</span> commanded the companies of the Rif Brig supporting the front line in the <span class="place">Quarry Pits (CARRIERES)</span>.
By his excellent dispositions and confident manner, he contributed more than any other individual to the success in holding this part
of the position. He was in command of the rearguard when the Eleventh Brigade retired from <span class="place">CARRIERE</span>, and was very seriously wonded and left behind.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Capt Boyd</span>. Perhaps the finiest young soldier I have met. A professional soldier of strong character, is a first 
rate Staff Officer and would make a capable commander. He is a gentleman, who got his commission through the ranks and is therefore old
for his rank. I recommend that he be promoted into some regiment as Major and given a Brevet Lieut-Colonelcy.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Capt Hon L.C. Palk</span> was in command of the company in the very exposed <span class="place">firing line S.W. of (CARRIERES)</span>. He 
commanded his company well and was largely influential in maintaining our position in this post.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Maj Salmon</span>, <span class="underline">Capt Brownlow</span>, <span class="underline">Lieut Campbell</span>. These Officers
led their company forward into the firing line in <span class="place">the Quarry Pits</span> after these quarries had twice been evacuated by other troops, owing to the heavy
fire. This company maintained its position in <span class="place">the quarry</span> until the end.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Col Jackson</span> was in command of the batt'n which was the left of our front line. He was throughout the day (and
throughout the campaign until he got wounded gallantly directing his men) a capable and gallant leader.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Lt Col Le Marchant</span>. A capable battalion commander and a gallant man. (Afterwards killed in action at <span class="place">LA FERTE</span>).
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Maj Prowse</span>, <span class="underline">Capt Connellan</span>, <span class="underline">Capt Jones-Mortimer</span>, 
<span class="underline">Capt Hon Morgan-Grenville</span>. Five exceptionally capable officers who proved themselves good leaders in the field.
The early advancement of these officers would be of benefit to the Army.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Capt Freestun</span> did valuable work as my Staff Capt during the fight and took over the duties of Brig Maj
after Capt Boyd was incapacitated by his wound.

<p>Annotation: This was marked Personal by General Boyd</p>
<h1>Retirement of 11th Infantry Brigade from <span class="place">Le Cateau</span></h1>
<h1>26th August 1914</h1>
<p>
You probably know that the 11th Brigade pretty well all right spent the night after <span class="place">Le Cateau</span> at <span class="place">Serain</span> (i.e. Wednesday night 26th/27th), the Brigade headquarters being <span class="place">the Padré's house</span>, which I visited years after, and the old man rememembered it all well. We marched early next morning across country to <span class="place">Beaurevoir</span> and thens more or less as shown on the map to <span class="place">Nauroy</span> where we put out some protective people an proceeded to get some food for the men. Here I met some of the Royal Scots under Duncan (now Major-General). All seemed quiet, and H.W. [Hunter Weston] and myself, with the machine-gun officer (Ovey), went to have some grub at <span class="place">the Chateau in the northern end of the town</span> (now in ruin). I was rather bad about this time, as my wound was hurting a lot. Suddenly a lot of firing, shelling by light guns, evidently H.A. broke out, and H.W. and Ovey (who took my pony) dashed off out of the house, leaving me to make my way out into the orchard with not much on, as Madame laComptesse was just playing about with my shoulder. When I got out, some of the Irish Horse dashed by, going hell for leather, and I luckily bumped into a party of the Rifle Bde. under poor Prittie, retiring steadily. I joined up with them and we picked up the rest of the Company on the Way through the village, and on clearing the village moved in the direction of <span class="place">Bellincourt</span>, through this village and then steadily on towards <span class="place">Tertry</span>, which we reached in the evening, and there got in touch with the Division again. Between <span class="place">Bellincourt</span> and <span class="place">Vendelles</span> (see black line on the map), we picked up about
<ul>
<li>2 Coys. Somerset L.I. under Prowse, or more</li>
<li>2 Coys. Rifle Bde.</li>
<li>2 Coys. Hants, under Palk I think</li>
<li>some E. Lancs and oddments.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
So we reached <span class="place">Tertry</span> eventually, following the line on the map, with a good part of the Brigade fairly all right. Put out outposts there, and it was arranged that the guns passing <span class="place">Tertry</span> that night on their way S.W. should pick up as many men as they could. You remember the rest.
</p>
<p>
As far as I remember, poor old Prowse was very good all this time, but the men were very tired. I managed to get in a country cart with some straw in it, and we met H-W and the remainder of the Brigade when we reached the 4th Division some time next day at - I forget the place.
</p>
<p>
I should say we had about 1,000 men at <span class="place">Tertry</span>, may be more.
</p>
<p>
I send you also a few old messages which may be useful. Send me them and the maps back when done with. The Colonel of the Hampshires was wounded outside <span class="place">Nauroy</span>, and taken prisoner.
