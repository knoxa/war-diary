   <p>Milder.  Conference of OCs Field 
   Ambulances at ADMS office.</p>
   <p>The admission of sick has increased
   in the past week to considerably higher than normal for the DRS. 
   This is chiefly accounted for by Fevers of uncertain origin or
   myalgia.  The numbers of cases of laryngitis has been somewhat
   remarkable – in nearly all cases loss of voice is the only
   symptom after the first few days when fever is present.  
   </p>
   <p>A weekly parade of personnel has
   been held on Thursday by myself and daily by the Sergeant Major. 
   ADMS conferences of Field Ambulance commanders have been weekly on
   Fridays at 11 am and the ADMS has attended here weekly on
   Thursdays at 09.30 am to see cases recommended for PB or TO and
   Trench Feet.</p>
   <p> Trench feet have been few.  ICT has
   been still prevalent on all parts of the body but especially on
   the feet due to boots being hard and rubbing no doubt.  The feet
   cases are the most difficult as they are unable to be returned to
   duty until perfectly healed , whereas other cases are fit in quite
   a few days.</p>
   <p>The severe weather has no doubt
   caused a high rate of sickness but the hate is still not serious.</p>
   <p>Attached chart of admissions with
   the numbers and percentage of the commoner diseases and daily mean
   temperatures.</p>

   <p>About 3 am Captain CROSSE returned

   <p>Steady flow of wounded and some v.
   bad cases (all Divisions, 39<sup>th</sup> ,23<sup>rd</sup>, and
   41<sup>st</sup>), also some gas.  One bad case of brachial
   haemorrhage, chloroform and op.  Up all night again.</p>
   <p>First work of wounded about 7 am
   different Divisions stretch and walking cases, the congestion was
   great til about 11 am, threatened to overcome one at times all
   rooms and passage full to overflow and many waiting outside, from
   9am was forced to send on all 39 Div. Walking cases to the
   Brasserie owing to the congestion, but at no time were we actually
   blocked and the evacuation by Horse transport, Lorries and Motor
   Amb. worked smoothly. 
   </p>
   <p>I was at this time unable owing to
   number of cases to issue Field Med. Cards to all I was also forced
   for same reason to send some onto <span class="place">La Clytte</span> without taking names.
   Many cases coming from <span class="place">Lock 8</span> – walking etc – who had
   been dressed and did not require redressing came in and added to
   the congestion, this was remedied.</p>
   <p>Capt LAUDER called (in a car) early
   morning and stated he was not able to find any of the Motor Amb.
   At <span class="place">Jackson's Dump</span>, assured him that they had been sent up
   according to arrangements (6 M.A. By 20 mins after Zero), also
   noted after inquiry that some of the cars had returned with
   wounded, only they were chiefly 39<sup>th</sup> Division –
   it was evident that a dressing station of this Division had used
   our cars freely and unknown to Captain LAUDER owing to telephonic
   breakdown.  Captain LAUDER was not able to get into communication
   with me (form <span class="place">Lock 8</span>).  Agreed to send up more cars according to
   his wishes and that if he so desired it he could have the use of
   every Motor Ambulance.  He reported that cases were coming in
   freely from the Adv. C.P.s and that there was a blockage at <span class="place">Larch Wood</span> – the trollies were practically useless from <span class="place">Larch Wood</span>
   and that he had been unable to use the Corps. Railway.

   on to <span class="place">CHIPPAWA</span>, further that no cars would call at <span class="place">VOORMOZEELE</span>
   either going or coming.  I pointed out that this would not

   traffic and the lengthened journey the cars would run serious
   chance of being further blocked between <span class="place">VOORMOZEELE</span> and <span class="place">CHIPPAWA</span>
   in addition to the blockage they were meeting between <span class="place">LARCH WOOD</span>

   times of the offensive to have <span class="place">VOORMOZEELE</span> blocked rather than
